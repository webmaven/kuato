            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p><strong>Last Updated: 2025-09-20</strong></p>
            <p>Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy explains what data the Kuato extension collects and how it is used.</p>
            <h4><strong>1. Data Collection and Storage</strong></h4>
            <p>Kuato is designed to be privacy-first. <strong>All of your data, including the books you load and your personal settings, is stored exclusively on your local machine using the browser's built-in storage.</strong> This data never leaves your computer and is never transmitted to the developer or any third-party servers.</p>
            <h4><strong>2. Permissions</strong></h4>
            <p>The Kuato extension requests two main permissions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to all URLs (<code>&lt;all_urls&gt;</code>):</strong> This permission is required for the core functionality of the extension, which is to fetch the content of a URL (like an article or an e-book) that <em>you</em> provide. The extension only ever fetches URLs that you explicitly ask it to. It does not access your browsing history or data from any other website automatically.</li>
                <li><strong>Access to <code>fars.ee</code>:</strong> This permission is used for the "Send" functionality, as explained below.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><strong>3. Use of Third-Party Services (Pastebin)</strong></h4>
            <p>To send text to your AI companion, Kuato breaks the text into smaller chunks. To avoid issues with message length and formatting, each chunk is uploaded to a public, anonymous pastebin service (<code>fars.ee</code>). This generates a unique URL for that chunk of text, which is then sent to the AI.</p>
            <p>This process is anonymous:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Only the text chunk itself is uploaded.</li>
                <li>No information about you, your account, or your browsing activity is included in this upload.</li>
                <li>The resulting pastebin URL is not associated with you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4><strong>4. No Analytics or Tracking</strong></h4>
            <p>The Kuato extension does not include any analytics, tracking codes, or advertising. The developer does not and cannot track your usage of the extension.</p>
            <h4><strong>5. Contact</strong></h4>
            <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.</p>
